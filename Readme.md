![Application Preview](./.github/assets/preview.png)

This is an advanced full-stack application for conducting interactive quizzes and tests. It has been designed with a dynamic and engaging user experience in mind. The application not only allows solving tests with a time limit but also offers immediate feedback, including AI-powered evaluation of open-ended questions. After completing a quiz, the user receives a detailed summary of the results and has the opportunity to review their answers for learning and analysis.

## 🚀 Project Setup

Detailed instructions for configuring and running the project—both in a production environment using Docker and locally on a development machine—have been moved to a separate document.

➡️ **[Read the Installation Guide](./docs/EN_INSTALL.md)**

## 🤖 AI Configuration

The application uses a default prompt for the AI model that evaluates open-ended questions. You can modify this prompt to better suit your needs directly from the Django admin panel.

1.  **Log in to the admin panel:** Go to the `/admin` address of your application and log in with your superuser account.
2.  **Navigate to Prompt Configurations:** In the `API_V1` section, find and click on "Prompt configurations".
3.  **Edit the default prompt:** You will see a default prompt named `default_prompt`. Click on it to open the edit view.
4.  **Modify the prompt:** In the "System prompt" field, you can change the content of the prompt. The prompt uses placeholders like `{grading_criteria}` and `{user_answer}` which are dynamically replaced with the question's criteria and the user's answer during evaluation. Make sure to keep these placeholders if you want the AI to use this data.
5.  **Save the changes:** Click the "Save" button. The new prompt will be used for all subsequent AI evaluations.
